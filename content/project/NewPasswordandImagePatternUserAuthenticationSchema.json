  "description": "A new authentication system that makes use of Password as well as Pattern drawn on an image.\n\n![](/images/project/hashgenerator-ss.png)\n\nThe proposed authentication system combines traditional password-based authentication with an\nimage pattern-based authentication to enhance security. Users must set a password and create a\nunique image pattern as their login credentials, divided into 16 grids. The image is not stored\non the backend server and is deleted immediately after the authentication process is complete.\n",
