{"id":"paper2","img":"/images/Paper2.jpg","title":"Performance Comparison of Two Statistical Parametric Methods for Outlier Detection and Correction","abstract":"Outlier detection and correction referred to as data preprocessing, is crucial in time series analysis and modeling. It has been a challenge to preprocess a volatile time series data possessing intricate trend characteristics. Two well-established statistical parametric methods, such as improved sliding window prediction and portrait dataset-based, perform adequate data preprocessing. While the former is equipped with an optimal window width selection approach, the latter, on the other hand, is based on a data visualization approach named portrait. This paper compares both methodsâ€™ preprocessing performance when applied to seasonal time series data with varying time resolutions and complex trend patterns for different content of outliers through detailed result analyses. Further, a new metric to measure outlier correction capability is suggested.","link":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896321014919","publisher":"Elsevier","date":"Nov 2, 2021"}
