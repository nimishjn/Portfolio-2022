The downsides of the existing comparison approaches are detailed, and substitute metrics, complemented normalized sum of absolute deviations (CNSAD) and overall preprocessing performance (OPP) are proposed. Also, the suitability of two derived metrics in revealing methodsâ€™ capability in handling extreme outliers is detailed. The merits of CNSAD and OPP are critically analyzed by applying to a set of polluted data with the synthetically embedded trend and volatility effects.","link":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-9033-4_63","publisher":"Springer","date":"Mar 25, 2022"}
