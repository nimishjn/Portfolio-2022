In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, I learnt the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.\n\nOnce I had the fundamentals down, I applied that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.\n\nAlong the way, I also learnt two important programming styles or paradigms: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP).\n",
