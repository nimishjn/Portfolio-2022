Later, I learnt modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a web form.\nFinally, I learnt how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a Twitter card with Flexbox, and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid.\n",
