  "description": "**Abstract**\n\nOutlier detection and correction referred to as data preprocessing,\nis crucial in time series analysis and modeling. It has been a challenge\nto preprocess a volatile time series data possessing intricate trend\ncharacteristics. Two well-established statistical parametric methods, such\nas improved sliding window prediction and portrait dataset-based, perform\nadequate data preprocessing. While the former is equipped with an optimal\nwindow width selection approach, the latter, on the other hand, is based\non a data visualization approach named portrait. This paper compares both\nmethodsâ€™ preprocessing performance when applied to seasonal time series\ndata with varying time resolutions and complex trend patterns for different\ncontent of outliers through detailed result analyses. Further, a new metric\nto measure outlier correction capability is suggested.\n",
